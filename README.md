Using https://github.com/storybooks/storybook
Forked from https://github.com/sw-yx/react-typescript-storybook-starter


# Usage

```bash
yarn
npm run storybook
```

You can also build your design system for publishing to private npm or your own github instance:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can also build your storybook for static file hosting so your designers can see it:

```bash
npm run build-storybook
```

Happy to take contribution/improvement suggestions.
